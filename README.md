# Dynamic-Restaurant-Finder
An interactive visualizations for a dataset containing the information about SF Restaurants Scores located in San Francisco. 

You can pin 2 locations and filter the restaurants by distance and review scores! Welcome to check the demo! Demo: https://chenchenpan.github.io/dynamic-restaurant-finder/

You can filter for restaurants in San Francisco based on distance and inspection score.

Upon opening the application, the default settings show all restaurants in San Francisco above the default value on the lowest inspection score slider. 

There are 2 circles, red and blue, that can be dragged to anywhere on the screen and adjust in size. There is the option to show just the restaurants that are within the radius of point A and B (in the intersection of the two circles). 
When the option is checked, the filter for the intersection of the two circles updates as the radius and location of the circles are adjusted as well.
